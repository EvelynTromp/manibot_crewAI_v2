Market Description:
These markets predict the percentage share of fossil fuels in global
electricity generation for each year from 2024 to 2100. Each year will resolve
separately based on the combined percentage of coal, gas, and other fossil
fuels, as reported by Ember Climate’s Electricity Data Explorer, rounded to the
nearest whole number. At at fossil share of 100% the respective market will
resolve YES. At 0% it will resolve NO. Results between 1% and 99% for the fossil
share will cause a partial resolution. For reference, in 2023, fossil fuels
accounted for 60.71% of global electricity generation—35.39% from coal, 22.56%
from gas, and 2.76% from other fossil fuels. This would have resulted in a
partial resolution at 61%. How to find the relevant data: Go to Ember Climate’s
Electricity Data Explorer. Select “World,” “Generation - yearly,” and “% share.”
Hover your cursor over the chart to display the exact numbers. The resolution
date is currently 30 June 2025 for the expected resolution of the 2024 market.
When that market resolves, the resolution date will change to 30 June 2026, etc.

GPT ANALYSIS PROCESS
------------------

Step-by-Step Analysis Process:
----------------------------
Given the market information and lack of direct research findings on the specific query "Share of Fossil Fuels in World Electricity Generation 2024 to 2100," we need to approach this analysis by considering broader trends, existing data on fossil fuel reliance, and global energy transition goals to estimate probabilities and identify trading edges. 

### 1. Probability of Each Possible Outcome

The probabilities provided in the market span from 2024 to 2100 with a general trend of decreasing reliance on fossil fuels for electricity generation. This aligns with global efforts towards carbon neutrality and increased adoption of renewable energy sources. However, the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources is complex and influenced by technological, economic, and policy factors. Considering the current share of 60.71% in 2023 and aggressive global targets to reduce carbon emissions, I estimate the following broad trends:

- **Short-term (2024-2030):** Slight decline in fossil fuel share due to existing infrastructure and projects. Estimated average annual decrease: 1-2%. 
- **Medium-term (2031-2050):** Accelerated decline with advances in renewable technology and stronger policies. Estimated average annual decrease: 2-3%.
- **Long-term (2051-2100):** Continued decrease, but at a potentially slower rate as the remaining fossil fuel usage might be in sectors harder to decarbonize. Estimated average annual decrease: 1-2%.

### 2. Trading Edges

Given the trend of the probabilities in the market data, it seems the market might be overestimating the speed of decline in the short term and underestimating the potential for renewable energy adoption in the long term. Specifically:
- **Short-term markets (2024-2030)** might be slightly overvalued for rapid declines in fossil fuel usage. An edge exists in betting against too sharp a decline.
- **Long-term markets (2051-2100)** seem to underestimate the potential for significant declines in fossil fuel usage. Here, an edge exists in betting on a lower fossil fuel share than the market currently predicts.

### 3. Key Factors Influencing the Outcome

- **Technological Advancements:** Improvements in renewable energy technologies and storage solutions.
- **Policy and Regulation:** Government policies supporting energy transition.
- **Economic Factors:** Costs of renewables vs. fossil fuels, including potential carbon pricing.
- **Geopolitical Factors:** Access to energy resources and energy security considerations.

### 4. Confidence Level in the Analysis

Given the broad trends identified and the lack of specific research findings or expert opinions, I would rate my confidence in this analysis as moderate. The long timelines and uncertainties in technological advancements and policy make precise predictions challenging. My estimates are based on the general direction of global energy transitions observed and reported by agencies such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) and scenarios outlined in reports by institutions like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

### Summary

- **Short-term (2024-2030):** Consider betting against too sharp a decline in fossil fuel share.
- **Medium-term (2031-2050) & Long-term (2051-2100):** Look for opportunities to bet on a more aggressive decline in fossil fuel usage than currently priced in the market.

Given the market's setup and the uncertainties involved, it's advisable to manage risk by not overexposing to any single outcome and to adjust positions as new data and trends emerge.

* Total Liquidity: 1041
* Current Probability: 0.00%
* Market Type: MULTIPLE_CHOICE (cpmm-multi-1)
* Unique Bettor Count: 8

Market Description:
Resolution Criteria: This market will resolve based on the Bitcoin price
achieved at any point from market creation to the end of March 2025 (December
17, 2024, 12:00 PT to March 31, 2025, 23:59 PT). Price Source: The primary

option will be resolved individually as soon as Bitcoin reaches that price
level. • If Bitcoin hits multiple price levels, multiple options can resolve
YES. • Options will resolve to YES immediately when their price level is
reached, rather than waiting for the final resolution date. Additional Notes: •
The price must be recorded as the high/low of any day, even if briefly achieved.
• Price figures are rounded to the nearest full dollar (e.g., $199,999.50 rounds
up to $200,000). • If Coinbase data becomes unavailable or unreliable,
alternative credible sources such as Kraken, Binance, or Coingecko will be used
for verification. • If multiple sources are used, the consensus price will
determine the outcome.

GPT ANALYSIS PROCESS
------------------

Step-by-Step Analysis Process:
----------------------------
Given the market information and the absence of direct research data on Bitcoin price predictions by March 31, I will base my analysis primarily on the market information provided, historical Bitcoin price trends, market sentiment, and my understanding of factors influencing Bitcoin's price. I will also consider the structure of the prediction market itself.

### 1. Probability of Each Possible Outcome

- **$200,000:** The current probability in the market is about 20.17%. Considering the historical volatility and growth trajectory of Bitcoin, along with current market conditions, this seems optimistic. I would assess a more realistic probability at around 5%.
- **$150,000:** Market probability is 29.78%. Given the bullish scenario required to reach this figure by the deadline, my estimate would be closer to 10%.
- **$130,000:** With a market probability of 45%, this seems overly optimistic. A more conservative estimate would be 15%.
- **$120,000:** The market places this probability at 74.22%, which is quite high. I would adjust this to around 20%.
- **$110,000:** Market probability is 85.67%. Considering the current trends, this might be too high. I would lower this estimate to 25%.
- **$90,000:** The market probability here is 67.86%. This seems more plausible than the higher figures but still optimistic. I would estimate a 30% chance.
- **$80,000:** With a market probability of 43.99%, this seems to be undervalued. I would adjust this probability to 40%.
- **$70,000:** The market estimates this at 27.33%. Given a conservative scenario, this seems reasonable, but I would slightly increase it to 45%.

### 2. Trading Edges

The most significant differences between my estimates and the market probabilities appear at the extremes. The market is overly optimistic about very high prices and somewhat undervalues the lower end of the spectrum. This discrepancy provides trading opportunities, especially in betting against the highest price points ($120,000 and above) and in favor of the more moderate outcomes ($70,000 to $90,000).

### 3. Key Factors Influencing the Outcome

- **Market Sentiment:** General bullish or bearish sentiment will greatly impact Bitcoin's price movement.
- **Global Economic Conditions:** Inflation rates, interest rates, and economic policies can influence investment in cryptocurrencies.
- **Technological Advances:** Any significant developments in blockchain or cryptocurrency space can drive prices up.
- **Regulatory News:** Positive or negative regulatory developments can have immediate impacts on prices.

### 4. Confidence Level in the Analysis

Given the lack of specific recent research data, I would rate my confidence in this analysis as moderate, around 65%. The rationale is based on historical trends, market behavior, and external economic factors. However, the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile and can be influenced by unpredictable events or news.

In conclusion, the best trading opportunities seem to be in positions that bet against the extremely optimistic outcomes and support a more moderate increase. The key to profitability in this scenario would be to manage risk carefully, especially considering the high volatility of Bitcoin prices.

GPT ANALYSIS PROCESS
------------------

Step-by-Step Analysis Process:
----------------------------
Given the market information and the research data, let's proceed with the analysis step by step.

### 1. Probability of Each Possible Outcome

Given the lack of specific research findings related to the shooting in Madison, Wisconsin, we must rely heavily on the market data, general knowledge about similar events, and the implications of the information being traded on. Here are the probabilities as listed in the market data:

- Manifesto posted by Slatzism is authentic: **83.38%**
- Discord screenshot about "moids" is authentic: **59.02%**
- The Google Drive link that requires permissions is related to the case: **66.22%**
- The shooter was trans: **6.48%**
- Motive has to do with racism: **46.16%**
- Motive has to do with misandry: **46.16%**
- Guns used were legally obtained: **40.98%**
- A gun used would have been banned under the 1994-2004 Federal Assault Weapons Ban: **44.36%**

### 2. Trading Edges

To identify trading edges, we compare our estimated probabilities with the market probabilities. Without specific research findings or recent news, our estimates must be based on broader patterns seen in similar past events, understanding of the market dynamics, and intuition about how new information might shift these probabilities.

- **Manifesto Authenticity (83.38%)**: Without specific data, this seems high. However, if a manifesto's authenticity is being widely discussed, it likely has some credible aspects. Still, given the very high percentage, there might be an edge in betting against it if any doubt can be cast on its authenticity. Estimated probability: 75%.
  
- **Discord Screenshot Authenticity (59.02%)**: Again, specifics are lacking, but Discord screenshots can be easily faked. The probability seems slightly high given the ease of manipulation. Estimated probability: 50%.

- **Google Drive Link Relation (66.22%)**: This seems like a speculative bet. The relation to the case is not clear cut without specific details. Estimated probability: 60%.

- **Shooter's Identity Aspects and Motives**: These outcomes have cultural and political implications that can skew public perception and betting. The probabilities reflect public speculation rather than confirmed information. Without concrete data, adjustments to these probabilities would be speculative at best.

- **Guns Legality and Type Used (40.98% & 44.36%)**: These probabilities feel slightly underestimated considering the patterns in similar past events where it was later confirmed that guns were often legally obtained. Adjusting these probabilities upward would be reasonable. Estimated probability for legal acquisition: 50%, and for the ban relevance: 50%.

### 3. Key Factors Influencing the Outcome

- **Public Perception**: Public sentiment and speculation can drive market probabilities more than factual bases in the absence of confirmed information.
- **Past Patterns**: Historical patterns in similar events can offer some guidance but are not foolproof.
- **Information Release Timing**: The timing of official information release can significantly impact these probabilities.

### 4. Confidence Level in the Analysis

Given the lack of specific research findings, the analysis heavily relies on market data interpretation, understanding of similar past events, and speculative reasoning. Consequently, the confidence level in this analysis is moderate to low. It's advisable to trade with caution and prioritize risk management, given the speculative nature of the market and the high uncertainties involved.

### Conclusion

While there appear to be minor edges in betting against the authenticity of the manifesto (due to its high probability) and adjusting the probabilities related to the legality and type of guns used, these opportunities are speculative. The lack of direct research or recent news to support these adjustments means trades should be made cautiously, with a strong emphasis on risk management. Given these conditions, the identified edges are small and should be approached with a strategy that accounts for the high level of uncertainty and the speculative basis of the current market probabilities.
